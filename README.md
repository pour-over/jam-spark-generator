# Improv Jam Spark Generator

## Description

The Improv Jam Spark Generator is a lightweight, single-page web application designed to help musicians and bands kickstart improvisational jam sessions. It provides random musical elements to inspire creativity and break out of familiar patterns.

This tool is perfect for practice sessions, warm-ups, or when you're looking for a fresh starting point for a new groove.

## Features

The generator provides random suggestions for:

* **Musical Key:** A random major or minor key to set the tonal center.
* **Feel / Groove:** A musical style or rhythmic idea, contextually matched to the selected key (major or minor). Descriptions often use Roman numerals (e.g., I-IV, i-iv, V7#9) for musicians to interpret based on the given key.
* **Vibe Adjective:** A non-musical adjective to inspire the mood and emotional color of the improvisation (e.g., "Spicy," "Velvety," "Chaotic").
* **Keyboard Sound:** A suggestion for the keyboardist's sound palette (e.g., "Organ B3," "Rhodes EP," "Synth Pad").
* **Who Starts?:** Randomly selects which musician (Keys, Bass, or Drums) should kick off the jam.

## How to Use

### 1. Locally

## Customization

2.  Scroll down to the `<script>` section.
